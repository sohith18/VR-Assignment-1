# Assignment Part 1: Coin Segmentation

## Overview  
This Python script processes an image of coins to detect and segment individual coins using OpenCV. It applies several image preprocessing techniques, including:  

- **Grayscale conversion**  
- **Blurring**  
- **Edge detection**  
- **Morphological transformations**  
- **Contour detection**  

The goal is to accurately **segment** the coins and **count** the total number present in the image.  

## Cloning the Repository

To get started, first clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sohith18/VR-Assignment-1.git
cd VR-Assignment-1
```

## Dependencies  
Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:  

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
```

Alternatively, you can install dependencies using a **virtual environment** with Conda:

```bash
conda create --name vrenv python=3.12
conda activate vrenv
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This ensures all dependencies are installed in an isolated environment.

## Running the Script  

1. Place the `Coins.jpg` image in the same directory as the script.
2. Ensure the `seg_coins/` folder exists in the same directory.  
3. Run the script using:  

   ```bash
   python Assignment_part1.py
   ```  

4. Segmented coins will be saved in the `seg_coins/` folder.  

## Displayed Output  
When the script runs, **three windows** will pop up:  

- **Canny Edges:** Displays detected edges in the image.  
- **Thresholded Image:** Shows the binary threshold applied to separate the coins from the background.  
- **Segmented Mask:** Displays the mask used to extract individual coins.  

The script will also print the total number of detected coins.  

## Methods Used & Observations  

### Image Resizing  
- The image is resized to **25% of its original size** to speed up processing and improve visualization.  

### Grayscale Conversion  
- Converts the image to **grayscale** to simplify processing by reducing color channels.  

### Gaussian Blurring  
- A **Gaussian blur** is applied to reduce noise and smooth the image.  
- A **(3,3) kernel size** was found to be the most effective, as it removed fine details on the coins while preserving their shape.  

### Canny Edge Detection  
- The **Canny algorithm** is used to detect edges in the image.  
- This helps outline the coins but is not used directly for contour detection due to potential gaps in edges.  

### Thresholding  
- **Otsuâ€™s thresholding** is applied to create a **binary image**, enhancing coin-background separation.  

### Morphological Transformations  
- **Morphological closing** (dilation followed by erosion) is applied to remove small gaps and noise.  
- A **(5,5) kernel size** was chosen as it effectively cleaned up noise while maintaining coin shapes.  

### Contour Detection & Filtering  
- **Contours** are detected from the processed binary image using `cv2.findContours()`.  
- Only **large contours (area > 15,000 pixels)** are considered as valid coins.  
- Each detected contour is drawn on a mask, and individual coin images are saved.  

### Counting Coins  
- The total number of detected coins is determined by counting the **filtered contours**.  

## Results  
- The script **successfully segments** the coins and **counts** them.  
- Each coin is saved separately in the `seg_coins/` folder with a unique filename.  
- The selected parameters were found to be **optimal** for this specific image.  


# Assignment Part 2: Creating Panorama

## Overview

This Python script performs image stitching to create a panorama from multiple images using OpenCV. The script applies feature detection, keypoint matching, homography estimation, and image blending techniques to seamlessly stitch images together.

## Cloning the Repository

To get started, first clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sohith18/VR-Assignment-1.git
cd VR-Assignment-1
```

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
```


Alternatively, you can install dependencies using a **virtual environment** with Conda:

```bash
conda create --name vrenv python=3.12
conda activate vrenv
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This ensures all dependencies are installed in an isolated environment.

## Running the Script

1. Place the two input images in the `images/` directory and name them `img1.jpg` and `img2.jpg`.
2. Run the script:

```bash
python Assignment_part2.py
```

3. The resulting stitched panorama will be displayed and saved as `Panaroma.jpg` in the same directory.

## Displayed Output  
When the script runs, **four windows** will pop up:  

- **Feature Matching:** Displays the matched keypoints between the two images.
- **Distance Transform 1 & 2:** Shows the distance transform of the images used for blending.
- **Panorama:** Displays the final post-processed stitched image.

## Methods Used with Observations

### Image Preprocessing
- **Grayscale Conversion:** Converts the input images to grayscale for feature detection.
- **Rescaling:** Images are resized to 15% of their original size to improve computational efficiency.

### Feature Detection and Matching
- **SIFT Keypoint Detection:** The SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) algorithm detects keypoints and computes descriptors.
- **Brute-Force Matching:** The BFMatcher with L2 norm and cross-checking finds the best matches between features in the two images.
- **Filtering Matches:** Matches are sorted based on distance, and the top 75 matches are used for accuracy.

### Homography Estimation
- **RANSAC Algorithm:** Homography matrix estimation removes outliers and finds a perspective transformation using at least four corresponding points.
- **Warp Perspective:** The second image is warped using the homography matrix to align it with the first image.

### Image Blending
- **Distance Transform:** Distance maps are computed for smooth blending.
- **Seam Smoothing:** The overlapping regions of the images are blended based on their distance transform values to reduce visible seams.

## Results

- Successfully stitches the input images into a panorama.
- Uses feature matching and homography estimation for accurate alignment.
- Displays the final stitched image on the screen.
- Saves the stitched panorama as `Panaroma.jpg` in the same directory.
- Seam blending technique enhances the visual appearance of the final image.
